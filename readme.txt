A major concern of the City of Paris is to optimize the public services provided to Parisians. In a context of the dematerialization of public services, we chose to test Target First especially for the associations. Target First was easy to install and to use. The interface and administration functions are easily understandable.

On the user side, this new helpline was quickly adopted and enjoyed. By the end, Target First allows us to be more proactive and to quickly and directly respond to the persons concerns.
